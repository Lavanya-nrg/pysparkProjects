## PySpark Projects: Food Orders Placement and Sales Analysis

This repository contains PySpark projects focusing on two main areas:

  **Food Orders and Placement:** Analyzing food orders and their placement across various platforms like restaurants, Swiggy, Zomato, etc.
  
  **Sales Analysis with Dashboard:** Analyzing sales data and visualizing insights through a dashboard.

## Food Orders and Placement
**Overview**

This project aims to analyze food order data from different platforms and gain insights into customer behavior, popular food items, peak ordering times, etc. By leveraging PySpark's distributed computing capabilities, we can efficiently process large volumes of data and derive valuable insights.

**Features**
  Data preprocessing to clean and format raw order data.
  Analysis of customer preferences, popular cuisines, and trending items.
  Identification of peak ordering times and geographical preferences.
  Visualization of insights through charts and graphs.
  
        
## Sales Analysis with Dashboard
**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing sales data and presenting insights through an interactive dashboard. PySpark is used for data processing, while visualization is achieved using popular libraries like Plotly and Dash. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore sales trends, product performance, regional sales distribution, etc.

**Features**


  Data preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
  Calculation of key sales metrics such as total revenue, average order value, etc.
  Visualization of sales trends over time and comparison between different products/categories.
  Interactive dashboard allowing users to filter and drill down into specific aspects of the data.


## Technologies Used

  **PySpark:** For distributed data processing and analysis.
  
  **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  
  **Git:** For version control and collaboration.
